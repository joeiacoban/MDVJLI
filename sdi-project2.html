<article>
<p>The theme I chose for my project was coming home from work and making dinner. There are some dishes that I want to cook but don't have the ingredients for them. I also end up burning my omelet and time is running out. It ends up being a disaster and because I was already extremely hungry, I just make hot pockets.</p>
